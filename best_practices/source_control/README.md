The series of documents in this directory describes best practices for source code control in [Terra
Workspaces](https://app.terra.bio/) for artifacts like
[notebooks](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360059009571-Notebooks-Quickstart-Guide),
Python and R packages, or
[workflows](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360034701991-Pipelining-with-workflows). The
goal of these documents is to enable you to manage, share and collaborate on artifacts effectively
using the source code control system [GitHub](https://github.com/).

The initial focus is on source controlling notebooks and not on other artifacts like workflows.
Source controlling notebooks is an important use case and will have a large benefit for Terra users
(including *All of Us* Workbench users).

If you already have some familiarity with GitHub, you may want to look first at the ['cheatsheet'
quick start](./terra_source_control_cheatsheet.md).

> **_All of Us_ Workbench**. The *All of Us* workbench differs from the general [Terra.bio](https://app.terra.bio/) system in a few areas. These differences are called out so that this solution applies to the *All of Us* workbench as well. The differences in the context of source control are addressed in the callouts with the left bar on the side â€“ like this paragraph.

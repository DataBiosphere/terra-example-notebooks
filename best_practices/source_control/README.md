The series of documents in this directory describes best practices for source code control in [Terra Workspaces](https://app.terra.bio/) for artifacts like [notebooks](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360059009571-Notebooks-Quickstart-Guide), Python and R packages, or [workflows](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360034701991-Pipelining-with-workflows). The goal of this solution is to enable you to manage, share and collaborate on artifacts effectively using the source code control system [GitHub](https://github.com/). In the following we use the term “source control” for brevity.

The initial focus is on source controlling notebooks and not on other artifacts like workflows.  Source controlling notebooks is a major predominant use case and will have a large benefit for Terra users (including All of Us Workbench users).

> **All of Us Workbench**. The All of Us workbench differs from the general [Terra.bio](https://app.terra.bio/) system in a few areas. These differences are called out so that this solution applies to the All of Us workbench as well. The differences in the context of source control are addressed in the callouts with the left bar on the side – like this paragraph.

    "As you can see, when cats are surprised, the result is an initial rapid gain in elevation followed by a corresponding reduction in elevation. The elevation plateau observed at the temporal mid-point as cat velocity approaches zero is due to the constant deceleration applied to the cat by the force of gravity. It at this mid-point that max elevation is achieved. \n",

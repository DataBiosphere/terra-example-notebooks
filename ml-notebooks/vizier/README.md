# Examples of using the Vizier HP tuning service

This directory contains some example notebooks that show how to use the [Vertex AI
Vizier](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vizier/overview) hyperparameter tuning service.

One notebook shows a toy multi-objective optimization, and one shows use of Vizier for tuning the
same Keras model used in the example notebooks [here](../image_classification/pcam/), used to do
classification of tissue sample images from the 'pcam' dataset.

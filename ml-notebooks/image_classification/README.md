# Image classification notebook examples

This directory holds image classification examples.

- The examples in the [pcam](./pcam) directory use the [PatchCamelyon benchmark](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/patch_camelyon).  It consists of 327.680 color images (96 x 96px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annotated with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue.
The machine learning task is to predict whether metastatic tissue is present.

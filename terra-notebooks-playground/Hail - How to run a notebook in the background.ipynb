    "# Run a Hail notebook in the background\n",
    "\n",
    "Terra users frequently use notebooks interactively to test [Hail](https://hail.is/) analyses on small portions of the genome. But running that same notebook over more data may take hours. For long running Hail jobs, if the browser loses its connection, users may not have all notebook cell outputs populated even though the notebook continues to run to completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "    <b>If you wish to capture all Hail notebook cell outputs</b>, use this notebook to run your long-running Hail notebook (or any other long-running notebook).<p>But also note that <a href=\"https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029761352-Preventing-runaway-costs-with-notebook-auto-pause-#h_de5698f5-3c82-4763-aaaf-ea7df6a1869c\">the cluster will autopause after 24 hours</a>. To prevent your cluster from shutting down if your background Hail job takes longer than 24 hours, be sure to log in and start a notebook, any notebook, in the same workspace as the notebook running in the background to reset the autopause timer.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use this notebook:\n",
    "1. Copy this notebook to the workspace that contains the long-running notebook you wish to run in the background.\n",
    "1. Edit the filename in `NOTEBOOK_TO_RUN` to be the name of the notebook in this workspace you wish to run.\n",
    "1. Use menu `Cell -> Run All` to tell the kernel to run this notebook to completion.\n",
    "1. Close this tab and do other work. (note: when you close the tab, the outputs in *this* notebook will no longer be updated, and that is fine, because what we really want are the outputs in the Hail notebook.)\n",
    "1. When the Hail job is complete:\n",
    "    1. Your Hail cluster will pause (if you have no other notebooks open).\n",
    "    1. You will see a copy of your notebook in the notebooks tab with a date and timestamp suffix --> this is the output file.\n",
    "    1. You will also see the Hail log in `gs://<workspace bucket>/hail-logs/YYYYMMDD/hail*.log`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you check back, and you do not see the output notebook, the Hail job is still running. To confirm this, first notice whether your Cloud analysis environment is still running. If it is, from the terminal run `yarn application -list` to see that a spark context is still processing data."
